# Base Media file parser

Simple parser and pretty printer for the [ISO Base Media file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_base_media_file_format).

This repo implements a little program that parses a sample file, pretty prints its structure and extracts the images it contains into an output directory.

To run the program, execute

```shell
$ ./gradlew run
```

from the root folder.
